/**

 * Write an efficient function that takes stockPricesYesterday and returns the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.
 * For example:
 *
 * var stockPricesYesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9];
 * getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday);
 * // returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)
 *
 * No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).
